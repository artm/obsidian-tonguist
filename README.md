# Obsidian Tonguist

Proof of concept for the following:

- manage language learning texts in Obsidian (can be done already)
- make review cards from text fragments with particular words
- link words from the cards to a personal vocabulary
- review the cards in their context, mark familiarity level, schedule next
  review with spaced repetition

Why not just export to ANKI or some other flashcard software?

- don't know a software that would properly deal with keeping familiarity score
  for the cards (particular instances of a word within a particular context) and
  the vocab entries (the root, core meaning)
- want minimalist aesthetics hiding the complexity of the underlying structure
- want to maintain the link to the actual source of the context examples and
  have it work both ways
    - score familiarity of the encountered cards while rereading the text
    - jump to the source text from a card review session
